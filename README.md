<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  This repository contains the source code for my personal IT portfolio website.
</p>

<p>
  The site reflects a structured approach to infrastructure development,
  disciplined technical growth, and a long-term focus on building reliable,
  well-governed systems.
</p>

<p>
  Rather than presenting generic lab artifacts, this portfolio documents applied
  learning, infrastructure case studies, and certification progress as they are
  developed and finalized.
</p>

<p>
  Reliable systems are not accidental. They are built deliberately — through
  structure, discipline, and measurable progress.
</p>

<p>
  This portfolio reflects that principle.
